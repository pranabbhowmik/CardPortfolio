          The front-end leverages <strong>React.js</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> for a modular and reusable component
          system. <strong>React Router DOM</strong> secures navigation with
          protected routes, while <strong>Framer Motion</strong> adds polished

          Accessibility was also prioritized‚Äîensuring text contrasts, ARIA

          Optimized queries, indexing, and schema validation were introduced to
